Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
ERROR: [Place 30-172] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE BACKBONE [get_nets sys_clk_i_IBUF] >

	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Rule Description: An MMCM driving a BUFG must be placed on the same half side (top/bottom) of the device

	Clock Rule: rule_bufh_bufr_ramb

	than the capacity of the region

	Clock Rule: rule_bufhce_mmcm
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: A BUFH driving an MMCM must both be in the same clock region

	Clock Rule: rule_pll_bufhce
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: A PLL driving a BUFH must both be in the same horizontal row (clockregion-wise)
	PmodDemo_i/mig_7series_0/u_PmodDemo_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i (PLLE2_ADV.CLKOUT3) is locked to PLLE2_ADV_X1Y1

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
